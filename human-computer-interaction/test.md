# Human computer interaction exam questions 

## Usability goals.

* Effectiveness

The general question of how effective the system is at enabling the user to preform the tasks they need to do.

* Efficiency

The amount of steps/actions it takes a user to complete a given task. For example: voicemail has bad efficiency because the user has to preform many steps to perform basic actions. Online shopping on the other hand has become very efficient by allowing users to buy items they want without having to fill in their details for every purchase.

* Safety

Preventing the user from serious errors or preforming unwanted actions accidentally. Examples of this include: making sure that 'save' and 'delete' buttons are not next to each other. Providing the user with various means of recovery should they make errors. Or asking the user for confirmation when performing 'dangerous' actions.

* Utility

Providing the user with the right tools they need to preform their tasks. For example providing free-hand drawing tools in a drawing application instead of restricting the user to use only predefined polygon shapes.

* Learnability

Making sure that users can quickly start carrying out the tasks they want when learning a new system. This is especially important for devices or software that is used very often. 

* memorability

Memorability refers to how easy it is to remember the how to preform tasks when learned. Structure and good sequence of actions to preform tasks are very important to ensure this goal.

## User experience goals.

User experience is less strictly defined than usability goal. The user experience should be enjoyable, fun, enteraining, rewarding, motivating, etc. In other words, the goal should be that user experiences no discomfort or irritation when using a system. How this is achieved depends on the type of system and the target audience.

## Usability design principles

* Usefulness
    * Value
    * Relevence
* Consistency
    * Consitency and standards
    * Real-world conventions
* Simplicity
    * Simplicity
    * Visibility
    * Self-evidency
* Communication
    * Feedback
    * Structure
    * Sequencing
    * Help and documentation
* Error Prevention and Handling
    * Forgiveness
    * Error recovery
    * Undo and redo
* Workload Reduction
    * Supportive automation

## Usability design rules. Explain the main three groups and two selected subgroups.

* Learnability
    * Predictability
    * Synthezability
    * Familiarity
    * Generalizability
    * Consistency
* Flexibility
    * Dialogue initiative
    * Multithreading
    * Task migratability
    * Substitutivity
    * Customizability
* Robustness
    * Observability
    * Recoverability
    * Responsiveness
    * Task conformance

## Conceptual models of interaction. 

* What will the users be doing when carrying out their tasks?
* How will the system support these?
* What kind of interface metaphor, if any, will be appropriate?
* What kinds of interaction modes and styles to use?

## Explain the four basic activities in interaction design.

* Instructing
    * Issuing commands and selecting options
    * Examples: 'print a file', 'save a file', 'vending machine'
* Conversing
    * Interaction with a system as if having a conversation
    * Examples: 'voice recognition menus', 'search engines', 'help systems'
* Manipulating
    * Interacting with objects in a virtual of physical space by manipulation them
    * Examples: 'dragging, selecting, closing, etc of virtual objects', 'motion controllers, wii'
* Exploring
    * Moving through a virtual environment or a physical space

## User analysis: stakeholders and their perspectives.

Stakeholders are:

* Those who interact directly with the system
* Those who manage direct users
* Those who receive output from the product
* Those who make the purchasing decision
* Those who use competitors products

Three categories of users:

* _Primary_: frequent hands-on
* _Secondary_: occasional or via another person
* _Tertiary_: Affected by its introduction

## Types of product requirements. Briefly explain the types of user requirements.

* Functional
    * What the system should do
* Non-functional
    * Memory footprint
    * Response time
    * System requirements
* Data
    * Kind of data to store
    * How to store data

## Task description: scenarios and use cases. Explain these techniques.

## Hierarchical task analysis: purpose, procedure.

## Low and high fidelity prototypes. What they prototype? Why and when they are used in the project?

* Low-fidelity prototypes

Made of simple materials without attention for astethics. Made quickly and should be easy to changes. For example sketches, wireframe or a paper prototype. 

Should be used in the early stages of a project to determine the basic workflow and layout of a system.

* High-fidelity prototypes

Should look and feel like the finished system. Should be fully interactive and include complex functionality.

This should be used when finalizing the feature set and design of a system. Can be used for testing with users and as marketing and sales tool.

## Explain the main types of social interaction technologies.

## Explain the three interface types (of your choice), related research and design issues

## What are the benefits of usability evaluations? Describe at least three.

## Describe the three types of usability evaluations.

* Controlled settings involving users

Laboratories and living labs. Usability testing experiments. The user's activities are controlled in order to test hypothesis and measure or observe certain behaviors.

Good at revealing usability problems, but poor at capturing context of usage of the system.

* Natural settings involving users

Online communities and public places. Little or no control over the users activities. Field studies to see how the system is used in real world scenarios.

Good at demonstrating how people use the system. Expensive and difficult to conduct.

* Any setting not involving users

Heuristic evaluation, inspection methods or modeling of user behaviour to identity usability problems. 

## Describe types of analytical evaluations.

## Heuristic evaluation: purpose, who performs it, how it is performed?

Heuristic evaluation is preformed by experts. They will each preform an evaluation of the system based on three questions: 

1. Will the correct action by sufficiently evident to the user?
2. Will the user notice that the correct action is available?
3. Will the user associate and interpret the response from the action correctly?

## Testing with users: purpose, how is it performed?
